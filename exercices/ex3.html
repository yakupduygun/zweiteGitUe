    <pre>
        Lily was a little girl
        Afraid of the big, wide world
        She grew up within her castle walls
        Now and then she tried to run
        And then on the night with the setting sun
        She went in the woods away
        So afraid, all alone <br>
        They warned her, don't go there
        There's creatures who are hiding in the dark
        Then something came creeping
        It told her, don't you worry just <br>
        Follow everywhere I go
        Top over the mountains or valley low
        Give you everything you've been dreaming of
        Just let me in, ooh
        Everything you want in gold, I'll be the magic story you've been told
        And you'll be safe under my control 
        Just let me in, ooh
        Just let me in, ooh <br>
        She knew she was hypnotized
        And walking on cold thin ice
        Then it broke, and she awoke again
        Then she ran faster than
        Start screaming, "Is there someone out there?"
        Please help me
        Come get me
        Behind her, she can hear it say <br>
        Follow everywhere I go
        Top over the mountains or valley low
        Give you everything you've been dreaming of
        Just let me in, ooh
        Everything you want in gold, I'll be the magic story you've been told
        And you'll be safe under my control
        Just let me in, ooh
        Just let me in, ooh <br>
        Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
        Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
        Everything you want in gold, I'll be the magic story you've been told
        And you'll be safe under my control
        Just let me in, ooh
        Follow everywhere I go <br>
        Top over the mountains or valley low
        Give you everything you've been dreaming of
        Just let me in, ooh
        Then she ran faster than
        Start screaming, "Is there someone out there?"
        Please help me
        Just let me in, ooh
